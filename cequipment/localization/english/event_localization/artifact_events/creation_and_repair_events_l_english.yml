 # Actor:
 fabrial_repair.2001.desc: "The frustrations of imperfection! I have this awe-inspiring artifact, yet its broken state tantalizes me with its potential!

 # Recipient:
 fabrial_repair.2002.desc: "Turns out the problem with [actor.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] [recipient.MakeScope.Var('repairing_broken_artifact').GetFlagName] was simply a misaligned gem housing! It's a trivial fix, and it's ready to be returned. This whole ordeal was silly - I should tell [actor.GetHerHim] to be more careful with the alignment in the future."
 fabrial_repair.2002.a: "At least I got paid."
 fabrial_repair.2002.b: "I can't charge money for this."

 # Actor:
 fabrial_repair.2011.desc: "The [recipient.MakeScope.Var('repairing_broken_artifact').GetFlagName] has been successfully repaired thanks to [recipient.GetTitledFirstName]!"
 fabrial_repair.2011.a: "Expensive, but worth it!"

 fabrial_repair.2012.desc: "[damnation|E]! According to [recipient.GetTitledFirstName], the [recipient.MakeScope.Var('repairing_broken_artifact').GetFlagName] was unsalvageable, to the point where there's no point even pretending it could ever be repaired."
 fabrial_repair.2012.a: "Oh no! And I spent so many spheres!"
 fabrial_repair.2012.b: "I refuse to believe it!"

 fabrial_repair.2021.desc: "My spies report that [recipient.GetTitledFirstName] has recently been showing off a new [artifact|E] to his other friends... An [artifact|E] which matches the description of the one [recipient.GetSheHe] claimed was lost! #EMP My#! artifact!"
 fabrial_repair.2021.a: "I knew it!"

 fabrial_repair.2022.desc: "My spies report that [recipient.GetTitledFirstName] has been expressing a sentiment of guilt to [recipient.GetHerHis] friends over the artifact repair debacle. They also found the remains of the artifact, and concluded that it had indeed been tinkered with and effectively destroyed. Unfortunately, our scheme was found out and now [recipient.GetTitledFirstName] knows I distrusted [recipient.GetHerHim] enough to send spies..."
