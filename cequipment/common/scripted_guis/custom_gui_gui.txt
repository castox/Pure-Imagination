# This file exists in order to manage the characters corresponding to the GUI functions GetDummyMale and GetDummyFemale.
# These are immortal beings that can be accessed and passed between script and GUI freely.
# This effectively makes them a Province of character type, and they can carry LocalizedText as global variables.
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY!
# If you want to append effects to these sguis, do it by creating custom on_actions that are triggered by the ones that are invoked here!

# For detecting if a GUI hasn't been active in a while.
