He fled to the countryside, where he lay low for a while, waiting for the dust to settle.\n\nHe received a summons from the newly crowned King Robert Baratheon. The King needed a man of Varys' talents to help him maintain order in the realm, and he was willing to reward Varys for his loyalty and not interfering in the war. The King offered him the title of Count of Blackstripe, a small but strategically important region on the border of the Stormlands and the Reach.\n\nVarys accepted the offer and took up residence in Blackstripe Castle. He quickly set about establishing a network of informants and spies throughout the region, keeping a close eye on the movements of the various lords and ladies who held sway there."
